# Machine_Learning_enabled_Firewall
This is project consists of python script used to build a firewall which has the ability to differentiate between 
good and bad queries.

The aim of building machine learning powered firewall is to eliminate harmful queries from the network and allowing only benign
queries.

The Logistic Regression Model is used to segregate benign queries from  malicious queries.

The accuracy for this model has been close to 85%, this model will deliver better results, if provided me with much more and 
better data.
